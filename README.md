catalogue-development
=====================

A place to discuss and find tips about catalogue development.

* [__Issues__](https://github.com/BSData/catalogue-development/issues) are a place to:
  * ask _questions_
  * take part in _discussions_
  * suggest _new articles_

* [__Wiki__](https://github.com/BSData/catalogue-development/wiki) is a place, where:
  * you'll find _help_ and answers to _FAQ_
  * we collected all _worthy tips_
  * we wrote about _most common patterns_ like weapon choices
  * you can share _your_ insights too!


How it's designed to work:
* Any new articles are best discussed in Issues.
* Then the Essence of discussion shall be written onto Wiki page
* and we need HELP with that.

This wiki is made _by_ and _for_ __all of us__, so _share_ what you know for the benefit of the whole community!
